##Used Resources
<p>
In this project, I only used the framework ReactJs to implements the redesign thought by [Roman Solodovnikov](http://https://dribbble.com/shots/5921162-Instagram-Redesign "Roman Solodovnikov"). With the help of other libraries like:
- Styled Components
- Unform 
- Eslint
- AnimeJs
- Prettier
- History

##Experience
Always I looked at the actual Instagram web design, I felt like it is missing something. So, I start search redesigns for the Instagram web in the Dribbble site (Yeah, its 3 b. for real). I found this redesign and started the development.
